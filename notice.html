    The schools network "firewall" currently is a extension enabled when logged in on a computer logged into google or safaria in your SCHOOL email, when logged off for now the school cannot gather information or find you doing wrong doing. In the future the school may install a firewall that analyzes network info but will most likely just ban websites while connected to the wifi, this is easily bypassable on a privatly owned computer using tor, etc  they will not invest in decoding all network activety although vpns will most likely get wifi banned and not be a realistic posibilty, as I develop my knowledge on Vpn tunneling, etc I will be developing a tool using proxys to bypass this block. If you are going to search or do anything for now DO NOT USE YOUR SCHOOL EMAIL WHILE DOING SO EVEN AT HOME THEY CAN TRACK YOU.
